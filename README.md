Hi there 👋
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to meet you here! 😊

Here are some quick things about me:

🔭 I'm a software engineer who is paranoid about convention, consistency, and constraints.
🕵️‍♀️ I like doing quality work, and a real asshole on pull request reviews.
🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion.
📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email.
